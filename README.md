# ABS 2021 Mesh Block dwelling counts to CSV

As of 31 August 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has only released the [2021 census Mesh Block dwelling counts](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/mesh-block-counts/2021) as an [Excel file](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/mesh-block-counts/2021/Mesh%20Block%20Counts%2C%202021.xlsx), with data stratified across 12 worksheets.  This is inconvenient for users who wish to link this data with digital boundaries, and not useful for data posterity.  In addition to completing a feedback survey for the ABS, suggesting that a CSV download should be provided (which the Excel file itself suggests is the case in its Explanatory Notes, and was the case with the 2011 and 2016 census releases), I thought it would be useful to take the time to compile these and make them public for myself and others until an official release is produced.
