# abs_mesh_block_counts_csv
As of 31 August 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has only released the 2021 census Mesh Block dwelling counts as an Excel file, with data stratified across 12 worksheets.  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with code used to compile national- and state-specific CSV files to assist users to more readily link this data with digital boundary files, and otherwise uses it in scripted analyses.
